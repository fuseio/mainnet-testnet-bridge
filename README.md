# Fuse to Gnosis Bridge

## Getting Started

### Setup

- Clone the repository
- run `yarn`
- Copy .env.example to .env and fill in with your private key

## Introduccion

The Fuse to Gnosis Bridge involves two token contracts: **NativeOFT** and **OFT**.

The **NativeOFT** contract represents the native token of the network where the contract is implemented, in this case Fuse. This token is used to wrap Fuse and create the **Native Fuse (FUSE)** token.

On the other hand, the **OFT** contract is implemented on the chain where we want to bridge, in this case Gnosis. This token represents **Native Fuse (FUSE)** in Gnosis and is called **Mainnet Fuse (MFUSE)**.

To illustrate, let's consider having native tokens on Fuse. The process involves wrapping those tokens in the **NativeOFT** contract and calling the sendFrom function. As a result, you receive **OFT** tokens on the destination chain, in this case Gnosis.

The main idea is to have a **WXDAI <> MFUSE** pool in Gnosis. Therefore, users can swap **WXDAI** for **MFUSE** and execute the sendFrom function on the **OFT** contract to receive **Native Fuse (FUSE)** tokens on Fuse.

The same idea works in reverse. In Gnosis, the **NativeOFT** contract is implemented to represent **Native xDai (xDAI)**. The process is similar to **Native Fuse**, and once the transaction reaches Fuse from Gnosis, **MxDAI** tokens representing **Mainnet xDAI (MxDAI)** are received using the **OFT** contract.


## Scripts

- **info**: This script takes the parameter 'network'. It shows your current token balances.

  Example:
  ```css
  npx hardhat --network fuse info
  ```


- **deposit**: This script takes the parameters 'network' and 'amount'. It wraps your native tokens and creates the NativeOFT token called **Native Fuse (FUSE)**.

  Example:
  ```css
  npx hardhat --network fuse deposit --amount 0.1
  ```

- **withdraw**: This script takes the parameters 'network' and 'amount'. It unwraps your native tokens and burns the **Native Fuse (FUSE)** tokens.

  Example:
  ```css
  npx hardhat --network fuse withdraw --amount 0.1
  ```

- **send**: This script takes the parameters 'network', 'amount', 'targetNetwork', and 'contract'. It basically sends NativeOFT or OFT tokens to the target chain.

  Example:
  ```css
  npx hardhat --network fuse send --amount 0.01 --target-network gnosis --contract NativeOFT
  ```

- **bridge**: This script takes the parameters 'network', 'amount', and 'targetNetwork'. It combines the functionality of deposit and send into a single script.

  Example:
  ```css
  npx hardhat --network fuse bridge --target-network gnosis --amount 0.1
  ```

- **swapAndBridge**: takes the parameters 'network', 'amount', and 'targetNetwork'. Essentially, this script performs a swap with the OFT token, in this case, the **Mainnet Fuse (MFUSE)** token implemented on the Gnosis network. It swaps **WXDAI** for **MFUSE** and then sends the **MFUSE** tokens to the Fuse network. To execute this script, there must be liquidity available for the transaction. The 'amount' parameter represents the quantity of native tokens you want to swap. 


  Example:
  ```shell
  npx hardhat --network gnosis swapAndBridge --target-network fuse --amount 0.05
  ```

- **addLiquidity**: this script adds liquidity to the pool based on the given networks. Take the **---eth-amount** parameter and call getTokenRatio, it automatically calculates the amount of token to add to the pool and liquidity is added.. 

  Example:
  ```shell
  npx hardhat --network gnosis addLiquidity --target-network fuse --eth-amount 50
  ```

- **removeLiquidity**: this script remove liquidity to the pool based on the given networks.

  Example:
  ```shell
  npx hardhat removeLiquidity --network gnosis --target-network fuse
  ```

- **tokenArbitrageAmount**: This returns the market price and the pool price and advises you a swap to balance the pool price, if you want to execute the transaction to balance the pool price you must pass the additional parameter **--swap yes**.

  Example:
  ```shell
  npx hardhat tokenArbitrageAmount --network gnosis --target-network fuse
  ```
   ```shell
  npx hardhat tokenArbitrageAmount --network gnosis --target-network fuse --swap yes
  ```
